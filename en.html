 <strong>Liam, Paulin and Thibault:</strong><br><br>
<strong id="titre">Wars, Trade and Cultural Exchanges in the Muslim World</strong><br><br>
The paragraphs below outline the wars as well as the commercial and cultural exchanges between the Muslim and Christian worlds during the Middle Ages.<br><br>

<strong>The wars</strong><br>
Christians fought several wars between the <strong>11th</strong> and <strong>13th centuries</strong>, mainly to defend their <strong>holy places</strong> that had come under Muslim control.<br>
Two crusades ended in failure, one was a victory (the <strong>First Crusade</strong>), and one resulted in a sack: the <strong>Sack of Constantinople in 1204</strong>.<br><br>

<strong>Commercial exchanges</strong><br>
Trade occurred between all regions of the world. Major trading centers included <strong>Baghdad</strong>, <strong>Alexandria</strong>, and <strong>Venice</strong>. Merchants exchanged all sorts of goods.<br>
Goods also arrived from <strong>South India</strong>: silk, spices, paper, gold…<br>
And primarily <strong>gold</strong> and <strong>slaves</strong> from Africa.<br>
With the development of global commerce, tensions sometimes arose. This led, for example, the <strong>Venetians</strong> to persuade the Crusaders to divert their expedition to <strong>Constantinople</strong>.<br>
Trade relied on both <strong>land and sea routes</strong>, following the itineraries previously studied.<br><br>

There were three types of cities: <strong>exporting cities</strong>, <strong>transit cities</strong>, and <strong>importing cities</strong>.<br>
<strong>Examples:</strong><br>
– Transit city: <strong>Alexandria</strong><br>
– Buying city: <strong>Marseille</strong><br>
– Selling city: <strong>Aix-la-Chapelle</strong><br><br>

<strong>Cultural exchanges</strong><br>
Empires around the Mediterranean exchanged a great deal of knowledge: mathematics, techniques, translations, and much more. Many scholars from all over the world gathered in <strong>Baghdad</strong>.<br>
A lot of Muslim and Byzantine knowledge was transmitted to Western Europe.<br><br>

<strong>Examples of transmitted knowledge:</strong><br>
– Paper manufacturing<br>
– Chess<br>
– Mathematics<br>
– Medicine<br>
– Scientific instruments<br>
– Book translations<br>
– And many other fields of knowledge.

 <strong>Nanami,Matis and Timothée:</strong><br><br>
<strong id="titre">Combat, commerce, and culture in the Mediterranean.</strong><br><br>

In the Middle Ages, in the Mediterranean, there were several types of contact between <strong>Orthodox Christians</strong>, <strong>Muslims</strong>, and <strong>Catholics</strong>.<br><br>

<strong>The first type of contact is <em>combat</em>.</strong><br>
Between the <strong>11th</strong> and <strong>13th centuries</strong>, Christians participated in several <u>crusades</u> to reclaim the holy places. For example, in 1187, Sultan <em>Saladin</em> retook Jerusalem.<br>
From the <strong>12th</strong> to the <strong>16th century</strong>, Christians also began to use medicine developed by Muslim scholars. This transmission of knowledge sometimes resulted from peaceful exchanges, sometimes from wars.<br><br>

<strong>The second type of contact is <em>trade</em>.</strong><br>
One of the great trading and spice cities is <strong>Baghdad</strong>, at the center of the Muslim world. There are many souks there and goods coming from very distant regions.<br>
From the <strong>9th</strong> to the <strong>12th century</strong>, other major trading cities developed: <em>Genoa</em>, <em>Constantinople</em>, <em>Alexandria</em>, and <em>Venice</em>.<br>
The products traded include <strong>gold</strong>, <strong>slaves</strong>, <strong>silk</strong>, <strong>perfume</strong>, <strong>precious stones</strong>, as well as <strong>paper</strong>.<br><br>

<strong>Finally, there are <em>cultural exchanges</em>.</strong><br>
Scholars from across the Mediterranean translated books, exchanged their knowledge, and spread their learning. For example, Caliph <em>Harun al-Rashid</em> founded the <u>House of Wisdom</u> in Baghdad.<br><br>

<strong>In conclusion</strong>, in the Middle Ages, the Mediterranean was a space of intense contact:<br>
— <strong>conflicts</strong> (such as the crusades),<br>
— <strong>trade</strong> (gold, slaves, spices, silk…),<br>
— and <strong>cultural exchanges</strong> (translations, scientific knowledge…).<br>
It was a place where three great civilizations—<u>Christian</u>, <u>Muslim</u>, and <u>Orthodox</u>—met, clashed, and influenced each other.
